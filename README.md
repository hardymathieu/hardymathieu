- 👋 Hi, I’m @hardymathieu , manager @hardy.digital
- 👀 I’m interested in building products
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to setup an IPFS node, create ERC721 tokens for my CV, to code with the Replit 100 days challenge, using Github efficiently, and some other things too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building products. Crypto products that are tackling the biggest problems today, ideally.
